auralink is intended to be a reimplmentation of uglink written entirely in
python.  uglink was/is a jack of all trades data handler that could read
data live from the UAS and serve it out to the ground station, and also
replay flights and do various other data processing tasks.  uglink has
evolved since the very earliest days of this project so it is extremely
messy and convoluted.  The goal is a fresh start, all in python, and
drop most of the dead weight along the way.
