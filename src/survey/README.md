# AuraUAS Survey Areas

AuraUAS can receive the outline of an area to survey will generate a
coverage route based on current wind, survey altitude, and camera
field of view.

The goal here is to avoid the need to transmit hundreds of waypoints
up from the ground station.  Instead, let the aircraft do the smart
work.
