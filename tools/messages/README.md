# AuraUAS message serialization and deserialization

Given a json declaration of binary message structures, automatically
generate C++ and python code to implement managing, serializing, and
deserializtion (pack/unpack) of the messages.

Messaging is an often repeated task that is subject to mistakes,
typos, and inconsistencies between sending and receiving ends.  This
system helps streamline the process, make the code more consistant
(autogenerated) and reduces the chances that one end becomes out of
sync due to a typo or mistake.

This system is conceptually similar to mavlink, but without also
defining 80 pages of standard message types.  The intention is for
this system to remain lean and focused.

* autogen.py: python script to auto generate C++ and python structures
  and code to manage the message types.
* example.json: an simple example message specification.
* messages.h: The autogenerated C++ header file including message
  structs and pack/unpack methods.
* messages.py: The autogenerated Python module that implements the identical
  byte stream serialization as the C++ code.
* example.cxx: An example C++ host program.
* exmpale.py: An example python host program.
